## Incomplete list of short tools descriptions.  

#### TESTING
* ###### Grunt - task manager
Grunt is a JavaScript task runner, a tool used to automatically perform frequent tasks such as  minification,
compilation, unit testing, and linting. It uses a command-line interface to run custom tasks defined in a file (known as
 a Gruntfile). Grunt was created by Ben Alman and is written in Node.js.

* ###### Karma
A simple tool that allows you to execute JavaScript code in multiple real browsers.
Karma is not a testing framework, nor an assertion library. Karma just launches an HTTP server, and generates the test
runner HTML file you probably already know from your favourite testing framework. So for testing purposes you can use
pretty much anything you like. There are already plugins for most of the common testing frameworks: jasmin, mocha,
qunit

* ###### Bender.js
Bender.js is a tool for distributed JavaScript testing on multiple browsers.
